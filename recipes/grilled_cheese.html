            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Grilled cheese sandwiches are a cornerstone of American childhood. The secret to a good sandwich is to slowly grill the buttered faces so as to allow the cheese insides enough time to melt to perfection while also allowing the bread to get a perfect level of char.</p>
