        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Oxtail is a dish that is made in many countries.  For this recipe, we will be using a jamaican style.  Oxtail is made from the lower portion of the spinal cord of a cow,which includes the tail.</p>
        <p>It is tough meat and so needs adequate time to slow cook. It is rich in gelatin and collagen.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds oxtail</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic and herb seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon browning sauce </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 carrots, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>3 cups low-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place oxtail in a shallow dish. Combine soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, sugar, garlic and herb seasoning, browning sauce, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a small bowl. Rub both sides of oxtail with soy sauce mixture; discard any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Sear oxtail in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side; transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Sauté carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in the same skillet until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef broth, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Add oxtail, with its juices, and butter. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until oxtail is fork tender, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Uncover skillet and increase heat to high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
