    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Caldo de res is a popular mexican stew that uses beef cuts and various interchangeable vegetables such as corn,
        carrots, cabbage, chayote, yucca, green beans, and more.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb beef shank</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 medium carrot, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 chayotes, quartered (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 ears corn, husked and cut into thirds</li>
        <li>1 potato, quartered (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 medium head cabbage, cored and cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat from the beef bones into about 1/2 inch pieces, leaving some on the bones.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy soup pot over medium-high heat until very hot. Add oil, tilting the pan to coat the bottom. Add meat and bones and season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until thoroughly browned.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until lightly browned; stir in broth and tomatoes. The liquid should cover the bones by 1/2 inch. If not, add some water to compensate. Reduce heat to low; simmer with the lid on loosely until meat is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Pour in 4 cups water, and return to a simmer. Add carrots and 1/4 cup cilantro, and cook for 10 minutes. Stir in chayote, corn, and potato; simmer until vegetables are tender. Push cabbage wedges into soup; cook until tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into large bowls, including some meat, vegetables, and bones. Garnish with cilantro, jalapeños, and minced onion. Squeeze lime juice over soup and serve with radishes.</li>
    </ol>
